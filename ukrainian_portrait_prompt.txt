A hyper-realistic portrait of a late 20s Ukrainian girl with a fair skin tone and medium-length, voluminous balayage haircut, featuring deeper chocolate and rich auburn tones blending into a dark base, styled in an intricate braided crown intertwined with delicate golden wheat stalks and small wildflowers. A few soft, lighter strands still frame her face, each catching the warm, golden studio lights like spun sunlight. Her eyes are a bright, captivating warm brown, radiating a mix of heartfelt warmth and quiet strength, her gaze both gentle and profound.

She wears a form-fitting, embroidered cream linen dress, inspired by traditional Ukrainian folk artistry with a modern twist. The dress features a deep V-neckline adorned with intricate gold and red embroidery patterns, wide, flowing sleeves gathered at the wrist, and a high slit subtly revealing her leg. The outfit incorporates delicate, sheer lace accents, with subtle, pearl-like beads catching the light. She stands serenely, her posture graceful and natural, one hand gently holding a small, intricately woven basket filled with ripe berries and wildflowers.

The background is a warm, sun-drenched field of tall wheat, comprised of distant rolling hills, vibrant patches of wildflowers, and an ancient oak tree with dappled light filtering through its leaves, providing a serene and enchanting backdrop. The outfit uses a blend of raw linen, soft cotton, and delicate gold thread; her skin is smooth and radiant, and her expression exudes a mix of heartfelt warmth and quiet strength, all captured with perfect clarity by the studio lighting. Perfect anatomy, ideal body proportions, perfectly rendered and intact hands and arms, and a complete, realistic body structure.
