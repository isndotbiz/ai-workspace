## Model Downloads History

### Flux.1-dev Core Models
- [ ] `flux1-dev.safetensors` (~11GB) - Main checkpoint
- [ ] `clip_l.safetensors` (~246MB) - CLIP text encoder  
- [ ] `t5xxl_fp8_e4m3fn.safetensors` (~4.7GB) - T5 text encoder (FP8)
- [ ] `ae.safetensors` (~335MB) - Autoencoder

### Photorealistic LoRAs
- [ ] `flux-realism.safetensors` - Enhanced realism from XLabs-AI
- [ ] `flux-skin-detail.safetensors` - Improved skin textures
- [ ] `flux-cinematic.safetensors` - Cinematic lighting effects
- [ ] `flux-face-detail.safetensors` - Enhanced facial features

### Workflow Presets

## Configuration Updates

### RTX 4060 Ti Optimizations
- CUDA memory allocation: `max_split_size_mb:1024`
- GPU device selection: `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0`
- Recommended resolutions: 1024x1024, 896x896, 768x1024
- Optimal LoRA strengths: 0.6-0.7 range

### Git Integration
- Large model files excluded via .gitignore patterns
- Workflow JSON files tracked for version control
- Configuration and script files preserved
- Automated commit and push workflows

## Known Issues

### Resolved
- None yet (initial release)

### Open
- Model download automation needs Hugging Face token configuration
- Workflow presets require manual creation/import
- GPU memory optimization may need per-system tuning

## Development Notes

### Dependencies
- PyTorch 2.1.0+ with CUDA 12.1 support
- ComfyUI and related AI packages
- Hugging Face ecosystem (transformers, diffusers, etc.)
- Development tools (Jupyter, Git integration)

### System Requirements
- RTX 4060 Ti 16GB (or similar 16GB VRAM GPU)
- Ubuntu 20.04+ or WSL2 with Ubuntu
- At least 50GB free disk space for models
- Python 3.8+ with pip and venv
