# Face Swapping Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to implement face swapping capabilities in our AI workspace.

## Phase 1: Research & Tools (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Study InsightFace + ReActor integration with ComfyUI
- [ ] Research IP-Adapter face conditioning methods
- [ ] Install ComfyUI-ReActor-Node
- [ ] Install ComfyUI-IP-Adapter-Plus
- [ ] Install ComfyUI-InstantID
- [ ] Test face detection accuracy with various image types

## Phase 2: Workflow Development (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] Create face extraction pipeline
- [ ] Build identity preservation workflow
- [ ] Develop multi-face handling system
- [ ] Fine-tune face blending parameters
- [ ] Create face database management system

## Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Integrate with existing portrait workflows
- [ ] Build batch processing system for multiple faces
- [ ] Quality validation pipeline
- [ ] Performance optimization for RTX 4060 Ti

## Phase 4: Production Features (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] Real-time preview system
- [ ] Face alignment optimization
- [ ] Expression transfer capabilities
- [ ] Style consistency maintenance

## Requirements
- Additional 4-8GB VRAM for face models
- Face embedding database storage (~1GB per 1000 faces)
- Advanced workflow JSON templates
- Quality assessment automation

## Estimated Timeline
6-8 weeks for full implementation

## Notes
- Start with simple face swapping before advanced features
- Focus on quality over speed initially
- Build comprehensive testing for each phase
