```

---

## Pending Tasks (Optional)

### 1. CLI Tools Update (Optional - Low Priority)

The following shell scripts contain GGUF references that could be updated:

**comfyctl.sh:**
- Lines 302-327: GGUF installation and pruning functions
- Lines 544, 564: GGUF model checks

**Recommendation:** Update these to reference FP8 models instead, or add FP8-specific functions alongside GGUF functions for backward compatibility.

**Impact:** Low - These are helper functions and don't affect core functionality.

### 2. Storage Cleanup (User Decision Required)

**Delete GGUF Archives (Reclaim 7.2GB):**
```bash
rm -rf archives/gguf_rollback/
```

**Delete Workflow Backups (Reclaim ~50MB):**
```bash
rm workflows/*.gguf_backup
```

**When to delete:**
- After testing 3-5 successful image generations
- After confirming FP8 quality meets requirements
- When comfortable with no rollback needed

### 3. Smoke Test (Recommended)

Run a quick image generation test to validate the FP8 stack:

```bash
python scripts/fp8_smoke_test.py
```

This will generate a test image and confirm:
- FP8 models load correctly
- Generation completes successfully
- VRAM usage is within expected range
- Generation time is reasonable

---

## Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

If issues arise with FP8 models, rollback using:

```bash
# 1. Re-enable GGUF custom node
mv ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-GGUF.disabled ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-GGUF

# 2. Restore GGUF models
mv archives/gguf_rollback/*.gguf ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models/
mv archives/gguf_rollback/*t5*.gguf ComfyUI/models/clip/

# 3. Restore workflow backups
for f in workflows/*.gguf_backup; do 
    mv "$f" "${f%.gguf_backup}"
done

# 4. Restart ComfyUI
pkill -f "ComfyUI/main.py"
python ComfyUI/main.py --listen 0.0.0.0 --port 8188
```

## Next Phase: Face Swap Integration

With FP8 migration complete, the workspace is ready for Phase 2:

### Planned Features:
- Install ReActor or similar face swap custom node
- Create face swap workflows compatible with FP8 Flux
- Test VRAM usage with face swap pipeline (estimate: +2-3GB)
- Document face swap usage and limitations
- Add automated tests for face swap functionality

**Target VRAM Budget:**
- FP8 Generation: 8-10GB
- Face Swap Models: 2-3GB
- **Total:** 10-13GB (fits comfortably in 16GB)
